    # FrontEnd development - Javascript
    ## ReDI School - Spring 2017

    ---

    # Where?

    ReDI Office near Nordbahnhof
    Am Nordbahnhof 3, 2nd floor,
    10115 Berlin

    ---

    # When?

    Wednesdays and Fridays from 19:00-21:00.

    Aim to be there at least 10 minutes before. We only have two hours at a time, so latecomers will be penalizing the whole group.

    We will have a tea/coffee/cigarette break halfway through the class - 5 minutes only!

    # What?

    In this course, you will learn about:

    - How to code with JavaScript
    - How to use a modern text editor
    - How to share code with others and undo your mistakes
    - How to create basic web pages
    - How to customize the look and feel of web pages
    - How to publish a web page for free
    - How to rent a domain name (.com, .de, ...)

    - How to read and modify data stored in a cloud database
    - Build a prototype of Zungebot, a simple web app that helps interpreters and people in need find each other

    # How?

    We will cover the following technologies:

    - JavaScript (we will prefer the new syntax introduced with EcmaScript 6)
    - HTML5
    - CSS3
    - Git
    - MongoDB
    - REST APIs

    To reduce complexity, we will standardize on the following tools:

    - Windows 10 (with at least Service Pack 1)
    - Window Subsystem for Linux
    - Visual Studio Code
    - GitHub Desktop
    - GitHub
    - GitHub Pages
    - Namecheap
    - To be decided: Mlab or Compose (for hosted MongoDB)
